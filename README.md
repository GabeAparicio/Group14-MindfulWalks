## 📱 Project Overview

**Mindful Walks** is a mobile application designed to help users unwind, explore their surroundings, and reconnect with nature through mindfulness-based scavenger-hunt experiences.

The app transforms everyday outdoor walks into mindful journeys by guiding users through GPS-based checkpoints that each contain gentle prompts such as:

> “Capture something that symbolizes calm.”

Users can save reflections or photos in a personal journal, track progress, and share completed walks via email creating an interactive and peaceful approach to wellness.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Many people feel overwhelmed, stressed, and disconnected while spending long hours indoors. Traditional mindfulness apps mainly focus on seated meditation, leaving a gap for users who want an active and exploratory experience.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Mindful Walks bridges this gap by gamifying mindfulness through:

- **GPS-based scavenger hunts**
- **Mindfulness prompts** at each checkpoint
- **Local journaling** for text and photos
- **Progress tracking**
- **Email sharing** for completed routes

The app combines movement, creativity, and reflection to support mental well-being.
